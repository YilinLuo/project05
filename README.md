- Yilin Luo (Technician)
- Emely Rosa (Visual Designer)
- Elise Frelinger (IA)

- Added a navbar and navbar items
- Added borders and backgrounds to Edit and Delete links
- Changed the color of all links to a darker pink

### Technician
- enabled the php condition that only allows logged-in users to see edit/delete/add options.
- changed the database setting and made sure everything worked in accordance to IA's editing of the webpage.
- helped debug some CSS layout related to logged-in & out changes of website presentation.
- coordinated the teamwork, and did the final validation on CSS and HTML.
-

### IA
- Adjusted choreography to remove extra steps and pages, make the end-location of links intuitive, and otherwise worked toward the "principle of least surprise"
- Made page names and classes semantic
- Made the login page visibly part of the website and easy to access; made the registration page difficult to find in the site itself so that only students can log in
- Adjusted links so that both the login and registration pages can redirect to either the index or student list, depending on what the user wants
- Made external links (including the Course Documentation website and the Lab 5's) intuitive, and set them up/verified that they would open in a separate tab
