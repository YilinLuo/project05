### IA
- Adjusted choreography to remove extra steps and pages, make the end-location of links intuitive, and otherwise worked toward the "principle of least surprise"
- Made page names and classes semantic
- Made the login page visibly part of the website and easy to access; made the registration page difficult to find in the site itself so that only students can log in
- Adjusted links so that both the login and registration pages can redirect to either the index or student list, depending on what the user wants
- Made external links (including the Course Documentation website and the Lab 5's) intuitive, and set them up/verified that they would open in a separate tab
